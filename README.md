## Introduction
In this project, using object-oriented programming skills, I have recreated a classic arcade game.

I was provided with visual assets and a game loop engine tools. Using these tools I have added a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

## Functionality

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

* The player can move left, right, up and down
* The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
* Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square
* Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won
